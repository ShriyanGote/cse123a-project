\section*{Decision Table}

Items to decide on:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Microcontroller
   \item Sensor
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Ultrasonic: Pointed down from the lid onto a floating object
        \item Load Cell: Place the container on the load cell to measure the weight and calculate the water level
        \item Laser: Shoots a laser into the water from the lid, and the distance is sent back to the sensor
        \item Camera: Setup to watch the water filter and measure the water level based on computer vision
        \item Non-Contact Sensor: Patch that sits on the side, when water level goes below sensor it can alert the device
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item Server
    \begin{itemize}
        \item HTTP
        \item AWS
        \item Vercel
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item Challenges
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Signal in the fridge
        \item Size limit
        \item Contact Vs No Contact
        \item Wifi connectivity
        \item Power source (battery, USB, etc.)
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\end{table}

Based on the decision matrix, the weight sensor is the best sensing 
method because it has the highest weighted total score (4.55). It performs especially well 
in measurement quality while still keeping cost, power, and overall complexity at a strong level compared to the other options.
