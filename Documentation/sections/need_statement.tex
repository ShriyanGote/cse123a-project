\section*{Need Statement}

\textbf{We want a way to know if the container is out of water when we need water. }
\begin{itemize}
    \item Avoid having no water left in addition to everybody using the water filter, not knowing there is no water left.
    \item Need a way to know the current water level of the pitcher so that it isn't empty without everyone knowing it's empty. 
    \item We need to know if the container is empty, in order to not run out of clean fresh water. 
\end{itemize}
