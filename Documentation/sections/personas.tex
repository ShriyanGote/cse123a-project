Occasionally, John comes out to get water only to find that the water is empty. This creates frustration and delays as John has to choose between missing the bus to refill water or getting to class on time while being thirsty.

        \item Jane Smith, 39 years old, working mother. Jane lives with her husband and two children. Jane gets home after a long, exhausting day of work and is feeling thirsty from the drive home.
