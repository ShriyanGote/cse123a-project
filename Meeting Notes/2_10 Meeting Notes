meeting notes 2/10
	- need and goal statements should be opposites, not mention the method
	- testing:
		○ test w real ppl, scenarios like leaving it empty, getting notif, only 1 person at home, etc
	- don’t need it all working together for functional prototype
		○ could have esp and cloud servers still unconnected
	- live notification is a stretch goal
    - status report does not need to say who did what

Design Tasks
	- improved timeline - stuff each person will do
	- drawing w filter, cloud, webapp
	- better diagram of all the parts above in table
	- components list?
	- Test plan
	- Test report
	- Life cycle assessment
	- ethics statement
	- script for demo (when to lift jug, etc)
    - instruction manual (qr code that links to online thing)    (due next quarter???)


--------------------------------------------------------
TODO (add these to issues board):

ESP32

    http get and post
    - sends percent
    - receives empty and full values

    weight sensor readings
    - output percent
    - recognize when it isn't placed (weight=0) to avoid false readings

    wakeup system (main file)
        - attempt to send/receive every second(?)

    using bluetooth to connect to wifi initially
    - esp receives data over http (wifi), so must connect to it a different way initially to send wifi name and password to esp

    detect nearby people w bluetooth?

Cloud server

    backend - host http server
    - send data btwn webapp and esp32

Webapp

    aesthetic prototype 

    display percent

    calibration system
    - send empty and full weights

    join/leave a group/household

    send notif based on percent

Hardware

    aesthetic prototype (CAD model) (not required this quarter but nice to have)

    4 sensors btwn two plates

    esp32 holding area (CAD model)
