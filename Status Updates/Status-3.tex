% talk about what we did week
\section*{What we Did}
For this week we continued researching parts and other components we will need for our project. We also started to think about everythign will be implmented and what we want to for our working demo. 

\section*{In progress}
We just emailed BELS about the parts for that we will need for our design, and until they respond, we are reseraching what is the best type of 
load cell we should use. for the other compoonents we will be using an ESP32c3 as the microcontroller, and we plan on hosting a server using Vercel and Supabase 
for the web app database. For the housing of the project, we will plan various designs and out of those we will 3D pring each design and test them to see which one would be the best.

\section*{What we need to}
While waiting on all the components to arrive, we are working on the implmentation of the web app and the server, and we are working on the desing of the housing. 
We will also start building the firmware for the microcontroller and the sensor, so we can start testing and soon it arrives. For our prototype demonstration, we will have load cell sensor 
connected to our microcontroller to which all of it will be connected to a computer that will output the water level by showing either a graph, or a number that will indicate the water level. 
We will also have a web app that will show the water level, however it will not be fully connected to the microcontroller, but it will be able to show the water level by using a mock data that we will generate.
