\section*{What we Did}

% talk about the sensor we are setting up and designing a base for

We have purchased the power module for this device. For the prototype we will be using a 3.7V 950mAh lithium ion battery. It will be connected to the ESP32 using the battery contact pins and a soldered on connector. Once we have set the device up in a way that we don't need to talk to it using USB for testing, we can power it solely from this battery. It should have more than enough power to support the board and the connected sensor.
