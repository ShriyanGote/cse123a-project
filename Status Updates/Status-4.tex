\section*{What we Did}

% talk about the sensor we are setting up and designing a base for

We have purchased the power module for this device. For the prototype we will be using a 3.7V 950mAh lithium ion battery. It will be connected to the ESP32 using the battery contact pins and a soldered on connector. Once we have set the device up in a way that we don't need to talk to it using USB for testing, we can power it solely from this battery. It should have more than enough power to support the board and the connected sensor.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Cloned the separate web server repository and tested if I can deploy to Vercel successfully
    \item Tested the server locally and made myself familiar with the codebase
    \item Researched ways to implement notifications to users when the water level is low
    \item Found two methods: text message notifications and push notifications.
\end{itemize}

\noindent I am leaning towards push notifications since they are more user friendly and can be implemented using a service like 
Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM). Text message notifications would require integrating with a service like Twilio, which 
have additional costs, while FCM has a free tier that should be sufficient for our needs. I will be working on integrating 
FCM into our web server and setting up the necessary infrastructure to send push notifications to users when the water level 
is low. I will also be working on writing some unit tests for receiving sample water level data and triggering notifications.\\
